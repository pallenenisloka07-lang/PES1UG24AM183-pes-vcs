# 📝 PES-VCS Lab Report - PES1UG24AM183


## Phase 1: Object Storage Foundation

**Filesystem Concepts:** Content-addressable storage, directory sharding, atomic writes, hashing for integrity

**Files:** `pes.h` (read), `object.c` (implement `object_write` and `object_read`)

### What to Implement

Open `object.c`. Two functions are marked `// TODO`:

1. **`object_write`** — Stores data in the object store.
   - Prepends a type header (`"blob <size>\0"`, `"tree <size>\0"`, or `"commit <size>\0"`)
   - Computes SHA-256 of the full object (header + data)
   - Writes atomically using the temp-file-then-rename pattern
   - Shards into subdirectories by first 2 hex chars of hash

2. **`object_read`** — Retrieves and verifies data from the object store.
   - Reads the file, parses the header to extract type and size
   - **Verifies integrity** by recomputing the hash and comparing to the filename
   - Returns the data portion (after the `\0`)

Read the detailed step-by-step comments in `object.c` before starting.

### Testing

```bash
make test_objects
./test_objects
```

The test program verifies:
- Blob storage and retrieval (write, read back, compare)
- Deduplication (same content → same hash → stored once)
- Integrity checking (detects corrupted objects)

**📸 Screenshot 1A:** Output of `./test_objects` showing all tests passing.

## Phase 2: Tree Objects

**Filesystem Concepts:** Directory representation, recursive structures, file modes and permissions

**Files:** `tree.h` (read), `tree.c` (implement all TODO functions)

### What to Implement

Open `tree.c`. Implement the function marked `// TODO`:

1. **`tree_from_index`** — Builds a tree hierarchy from the index.
   - Handles nested paths: `"src/main.c"` must create a `src` subtree
   - This is what `pes commit` uses to create the snapshot
   - Writes all tree objects to the object store and returns the root hash

### Testing

```bash
make test_tree
./test_tree
```

The test program verifies:
- Serialize → parse roundtrip preserves entries, modes, and hashes
- Deterministic serialization (same entries in any order → identical output)

**📸 Screenshot 2A:** Output of `./test_tree` showing all tests passing.
<img width="770" height="179" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/8058a57b-d9db-4902-b3dd-1f09568e4fbb" />
**📸 Screenshot 2B:** Pick a tree object from `find .pes/objects -type f` and run `xxd .pes/objects/XX/YYY... | head -20` to show the raw binary format.

## Phase 3: The Index (Staging Area)

**Filesystem Concepts:** File format design, atomic writes, change detection using metadata

**Files:** `index.h` (read), `index.c` (implement all TODO functions)

### What to Implement

Open `index.c`. Three functions are marked `// TODO`:

1. **`index_load`** — Reads the text-based `.pes/index` file into an `Index` struct.
   - If the file doesn't exist, initializes an empty index (this is not an error)
   - Parses each line: `<mode> <hash-hex> <mtime> <size> <path>`

2. **`index_save`** — Writes the index atomically (temp file + rename).
   - Sorts entries by path before writing
   - Uses `fsync()` on the temp file before renaming

3. **`index_add`** — Stages a file: reads it, writes  blob to object store, updates index entry.
   - Use the provided `index_find` to check for an existing entry

`index_find` , `index_status` and `index_remove` are already implemented for you — read them to understand the index data structure before starting.

#### Expected Output of `pes status`

```
Staged changes:
  staged:     hello.txt
  staged:     src/main.c

Unstaged changes:
  modified:   README.md
  deleted:    old_file.txt

Untracked files:
  untracked:  notes.txt
```
If a section has no entries, print the header followed by `(nothing to show)`.

### Testing

```bash
make pes
./pes init
echo "hello" > file1.txt
echo "world" > file2.txt
./pes add file1.txt file2.txt
./pes status
cat .pes/index    # Human-readable text format
```

**📸 Screenshot 3A:** Run `./pes init`, `./pes add file1.txt file2.txt`, `./pes status` — show the output.

## Phase 4: Commits and History

**Filesystem Concepts:** Linked structures on disk, reference files, atomic pointer updates

**Files:** `commit.h` (read), `commit.c` (implement all TODO functions)

### What to Implement

Open `commit.c`. One function is marked `// TODO`:

1. **`commit_create`** — The main commit function:
   - Builds a tree from the index using `tree_from_index()` (**not** from the working directory — commits snapshot the staged state)
   - Reads current HEAD as the parent (may not exist for first commit)
   - Gets the author string from `pes_author()` (defined in `pes.h`)
   - Writes the commit object, then updates HEAD

`commit_parse`, `commit_serialize`, `commit_walk`, `head_read`, and `head_update` are already implemented — read them to understand the commit format before writing `commit_create`.

The commit text format is specified in the comment at the top of `commit.c`.
### Testing

```bash
./pes init
echo "Hello" > hello.txt
./pes add hello.txt
./pes commit -m "Initial commit"

echo "World" >> hello.txt
./pes add hello.txt
./pes commit -m "Add world"

echo "Goodbye" > bye.txt
./pes add bye.txt
./pes commit -m "Add farewell"

./pes log
```

You can also run the full integration test:

```bash
make test-integration
```

**📸 Screenshot 4A:** Output of `./pes log` showing three commits with hashes, authors, timestamps, and messages.

## Phase 5 & 6: Analysis-Only Questions

The following questions cover filesystem concepts beyond the implementation scope of this lab. Answer them in writing — no code required.

### Branching and Checkout

**Q5.1:** A branch in Git is just a file in `.git/refs/heads/` containing a commit hash. Creating a branch is creating a file. Given this, how would you implement `pes checkout <branch>` — what files need to change in `.pes/`, and what must happen to the working directory? What makes this operation complex?

**Q5.2:** When switching branches, the working directory must be updated to match the target branch's tree. If the user has uncommitted changes to a tracked file, and that file differs between branches, checkout must refuse. Describe how you would detect this "dirty working directory" conflict using only the index and the object store.

**Q5.3:** "Detached HEAD" means HEAD contains a commit hash directly instead of a branch reference. What happens if you make commits in this state? How could a user recover those commits?

### Garbage Collection and Space Reclamation

**Q6.1:** Over time, the object store accumulates unreachable objects — blobs, trees, or commits that no branch points to (directly or transitively). Describe an algorithm to find and delete these objects. What data structure would you use to track "reachable" hashes efficiently? For a repository with 100,000 commits and 50 branches, estimate how many objects you'd need to visit.

**Q6.2:** Why is it dangerous to run garbage collection concurrently with a commit operation? Describe a race condition where GC could delete an object that a concurrent commit is about to reference. How does Git's real GC avoid this?

## Submission Requirements

**1. GitHub Repository**
* You must submit the link to your GitHub repository via the official submission link (which will be shared by your respective faculty).
* The repository must strictly maintain the directory structure you built throughout this lab.
* Ensure your github repository is made `public`

**2. Lab Report**
* Your report, containing all required **screenshots** and answers to the **analysis questions**, must be placed at the **root** of your repository directory.
* The report must be submitted as either a PDF (`report.pdf`) or a Markdown file (`README.md`).

**3. Commit History (Graded Requirement)**
* **Minimum Requirement:** You must have a minimum of **5 commits per phase** with appropriate commit messages. Submitting fewer than 5 commits for any given phase will result in a deduction of marks.
* **Best Practices:** We highly prefer more than 5 detailed commits per phase. Granular commits that clearly show the delta in code block changes allow us to verify your step-by-step understanding of the concepts and prevent penalties <3

## Phase 5: Branching and Checkout
### Q5.1: How to implement `pes checkout <branch>`
To implement this, I'd update the `.pes/HEAD` file to point to the new branch ref. Then, the working directory needs to be cleared and repopulated with files from the branch's latest commit by walking its tree object. The main challenge is making sure you don't overwrite any unsaved (dirty) work or delete files that aren't part of the VCS.

### Q5.2: Detecting a "Dirty" Working Directory
You can detect "dirty" files by comparing the current file’s SHA-256 hash with the one stored in the index. If the hash on disk doesn't match the index or the last commit, the file has been modified. Checkout should always check this first and stop if it’s about to lose the user's uncommitted data.

### Q5.3: Dealing with a Detached HEAD
A detached HEAD happens when you point directly to a commit hash instead of a branch name. You can still make commits, but they aren't "anchored" to a branch, so they can easily get lost if you switch away. To recover them, you’d have to find the specific commit hash from the logs and manually create a new branch for it.

## Phase 6: Garbage Collection (GC)

### Q6.1: Mark-and-Sweep Cleanup
GC works like a cleanup crew: first, it "marks" everything that's still being used by starting from the branches and following all the links to files and folders. Then, it "sweeps" (deletes) any objects in the `.pes/objects` folder that weren't marked. For 100k commits, this is efficient because SHA-256 deduplication ensures we only ever store and visit unique files once.

### Q6.2: GC Race Conditions
It's dangerous to run GC while committing because GC might decide to delete a file just as a new commit is trying to reference it. Git prevents this with a "grace period"—it only deletes orphaned objects that are older than two weeks, allowing active operations to finish safely.
